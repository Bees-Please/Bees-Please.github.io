            <p>hi! this is a quick first post to my blog, i needed somewhere to jot down some ideas in a place where
                folks could come and pass by them in a weird voyeur style art display of my stream of consciousness
                style word vomit.</p>
            <p>on brand for me, i've been procrastinating doing this for a couple of months, but finally i'm just making
                an initial text post.</p>
            <p>so lets talk about...</p>
            <h2>The blog</h2>
            <p>the blog you're reading is hosted on github pages which passes through my domain, i plan on moving into a
                flask server on a self-hosted machine when i have more time after my classes are over this semester.</p>
            <p>blog posts start in pycharm, where a script creates a markdown file, and 2 folder structures that allow
                me to start doing the actual writing without needing to really go and create the folder structure
                myself. i want to try and post regularly monthly, if you're interested in reading these, check back
                every month for updates! eventually there will be a news letter when i get to it.</p>
            <p>after creating the folder structure and markdown files, i come in here and write my thoughts out. there's
                really no particular format or structure, i dont really plan on doing so as this is supposed to be my
                freeform thoughts.</p>
            <p>i do plan on creating a personal vs professional blog that will be more organized but for now; the
                pycharm script then takes the markdown and renders it as HTML where it is injected into a new HTML file,
                which becomes the page, and boom! blog post. I just add it to list index for blog posts, and then it's
                served up :)</p>
            <p>consider these blog posts non-verifiable for now until i place my gpg signature up, but whence i do,
                there will be a write up about it.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>please stay safe in these interesting times, donate to your local rescue, tip your waiters, trans rights,
                and most importantly</p>
